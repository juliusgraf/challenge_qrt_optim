## Optimization algorithms for neural networks to predict football scores

Short academic project inspired by "Challenge Data - Football: Can you guess the winner?" (see https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/143/) to study the behavior of a neural networks learning process with respect to the optimization algorithm used for the training. This project is part of the UC Berkeley Fall 2024 graduate class INDENG 240 Optimization Analytics taught by Prof. Phillip Kerger.
